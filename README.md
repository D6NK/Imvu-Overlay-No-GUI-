  >The height will be modified automatically when you enable the modifier.

- You can Find the icon for this application in your tray icons on your taskbar. Right click for options such as reloading or exiting the application. 
  > You can even edit the script if you know what youre doing. If you dont then good luck. If you do then let me know if you make it better!

# while modifier is active:

- When Imvu is not the currently active It will be unclickable
  > You will need to alt tab to IMVU in order to type in chat.

- You have the option to make the background blurred by pressing Left Control and Alt and B at the same time.
  >  Disable the background blur by pressing the key combination again.

# F.A.Q.

- Inline Documentation is poor because I'm lazy.

- HELP! it looks weird and I can see notifications and things that are ugly, absurd or obnoxious!
  > Solution (maybe, probably, fingers crossed):
    > Just press the windows key and i combo to disable and reenable the modifier.
